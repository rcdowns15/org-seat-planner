# Progress Log

Newest first. Navigator updates "Where we stand" at each check-in.

## Where we stand
- **Last updated:** 2026-11-12 · LR-01-03 merged; LR-01-04 (PR #3) rebased onto `main` for CI (orchestrator)
- **Milestone:** M1 — Foundations (BR-01), 4 of 10 little rocks done (LR-01-01, LR-01-02, LR-01-03, LR-01-10). LR-01-05 linking done (only the live `/api/health` check is left, after LR-01-04).
- **In flight:** LR-01-04 in review: https://github.com/rcdowns15/org-seat-planner/pull/3 (rebased; CI running).
- **Blocked:** none
- **Waiting on Rob:** merge PR #3 once CI is green; stop the leftover `next start` on port 3000 (PID 4076); LR-01-05 health check once PR #3 merges and deploys; LR-01-09 once LR-01-08 merges. Optional: a ruleset requiring the `checks` and `e2e` status checks on PRs.
- **Next:** LR-01-06 (Opus executor) once PR #3 merges → LR-01-07 → LR-01-08 · owner: orchestrator

Rewrite this block (don't append) whenever plan state changes; commit with the change.

## Production
- Live URL: (set in LR-01-05)
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/rcdowns15/org-seat-planner

## Runbook
- Neon cold start → first request after idle takes a few seconds → load the board once before demoing.
- Demo data messed up by visitors → board looks wrong → "Reset demo data" button, or run `db-deploy` with `reseed: true`.
- `pnpm test:db` fails to connect → Docker isn't running → `docker compose up -d db`.

## Log
- 2026-11-12 — LR-01-03 done: PR #2 merged; CI now runs on every PR and push to `main`.
- 2026-11-12 — LR-01-04 → `review`: PR #3 (Sonnet; four reviewer P2s fixed: pool error listener, local-only test DB guard, `.env.example` unpooled URL, compose project name).
- 2026-11-12 — LR-01-03 → `review`: PR #2 (Sonnet; reviewer P2 empty failure artifact fixed; CI green, failing-lint demo run 43127741879).
- 2026-11-12 — LR-01-02 done: PR #1 merged. LR-01-03 and LR-01-04 dispatched in parallel.
- 2026-11-11 — LR-01-02 → `review`: PR #1 opened (Sonnet executor; reviewer pass, P2 duplicate `cn` helper fixed; Vercel preview builds).
- 2026-11-11 — D-029 accepted: the Workday report and `workday.workers` gain `Position_ID`, `Cost_Center` and `Location` (LR-01-06 and LR-01-07 criteria updated); the seat ↔ position link is parked until BR-07.
- 2026-11-11 — LR-01-07 criteria tightened (orchestrator, Rob's OK): documented Workday report layout with a header-match test and Rob's sign-off, plus a plausibility test (span of control 3–15, no manager cycles, date ordering). Open question for the navigator: add `Position_ID`, cost center and location to the report and `workday.workers` (touches LR-01-06).
- 2026-11-11 — Rob accepted all decisions D-001…D-028. LR-01-02 → `ready`. BR-01 orchestrator brief handed off.
- 2026-11-11 — LR-01-10 done: `docker run --rm hello-world` passed after the restart. Nothing blocks LR-01-02 on the machine side now.
- 2026-11-11 — LR-01-05 started: Vercel project `rob-c8e4/org-seat-planner` created and linked locally; `DEMO_MODE=true` set for production and preview. Blocked on Rob in the browser: accept Neon Marketplace terms, add a GitHub login connection to the Vercel account.
- 2026-11-11 — LR-01-01 done: public repo `rcdowns15/org-seat-planner` created and `main` pushed. Branch protection deferred (would block the orchestrator's status commits to `main`).
- 2026-11-11 — Rob: 5 h/day confirmed; repo name `org-seat-planner`; D-012 accepted; drop order confirmed (write-back extras before pipeline). Machine check found Docker missing, long paths off, pnpm missing → added LR-01-10 (rob).
- 2026-11-11 — Repo scaffolded from the harness template (docs and agents only).
- 2026-11-11 — Planning session: master plan, eight big rock specs, decisions D-001–D-028 (all proposed), parking lot. Re-cut for a 4-day timeline as a thin slice through every layer (write-back, Workday ingestion, dbt reconciliation); read-only SQL panel added (LR-02-08) at Rob's request; undo and audit page moved after the interview.
